# Horiseon Social Solution Services

 This project aims to ensure that a webpage meets accessibility standards. Accessibility refers to the practice of making web content and websites usable by people of all abilities and disabilities. This includes those with visual, auditory, physical, cognitive, and neurological impairments. This project taught me how to build semantic HTML file and importance of alt attributes.

## This site was optimized by adhering to the following criteria:
* Semantic HTML elements are used in the source code.
* The structure of the HTML elements follows a logical order independent of styling and positioning.
* Icon and image elements have accessible alt attributes.
* Heading attributes are in sequential order.
* The title element is concise and descriptive.

## Mock up
![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

## Testing
You can also refer to source code to test it [Source code](https://github.com/IaroslavLasiichuk/week1-challenge/blob/main/index.html).

To test that these criteria have been met, follow these steps:

* View the source code of the webpage.
* Look for the use of semantic HTML elements, such as header, main, and footer.
* View the structure of the HTML elements and ensure that they follow a logical order.
* Check that icon and image elements have accessible alt attributes.
* Verify that heading attributes are in sequential order (e.g. h1, h2, h3, etc.).
* Check the title element to ensure it is concise and descriptive.

## Conclusion
By following the acceptance criteria and testing steps outlined in this document, you can ensure that a webpage meets accessibility standards and is usable by people of all abilities and disabilities.
